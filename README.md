This project implements a recommendation system that suggests movies, books, and music based on user preferences and historical data.

## Features

- **Multi-domain Recommendations**: This system provides recommendations across multiple domains, including movies, books, and music.
- **User Preferences Analysis**: Utilizing user data and preferences, the system analyzes and recommends items tailored to individual tastes.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implements collaborative filtering techniques to suggest items based on similar user preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Utilizes content-based filtering to recommend items similar to those already liked or interacted with by the user.
- **Hybrid Recommendations**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to provide diverse and accurate recommendations.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with scalability in mind to handle large datasets and growing user bases efficiently.
- **Interactive Interface**: Provides an interactive interface for users to input preferences, explore recommendations, and provide feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for developing the recommendation algorithms and system logic.
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilized for machine learning algorithms such as collaborative and content-based filtering.
- **Streamlit**: Used for designing and developing the frontend interface for users.
